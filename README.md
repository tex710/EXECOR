## About

Execor is a utility designed to provide a centralized and secure platform for managing various gaming-related tools and credentials. The project was born from the need for a unified solution to handle cheat loaders, forum logins, and Steam accounts, offering a seamless and efficient user experience. While initially a personal project, Execor has evolved into a robust application for the wider gaming community.

Our mission is to provide a powerful, user-friendly, and secure tool that simplifies the management of your gaming utilities. We are committed to continuous improvement and welcome feedback from our user community.
